I have created this calculator to make it easier for myself (and others) to decide where I should move post-graduation.

It helps me decide: where2live

I will soon host this on Heroku with very basic webpage form. But, for now...
  1. Navigate to your config.py and change the cities you are considering and your job title
  2. Then simply run python3 costCalculator.py
  3. You will see in your console some new messages
  4. Happy decision making

Notes:
  At the moment, this is very crude as I did this in a few hours.
  TO DO:
    Front End for Results Page
    Submitting Form triggers function call!

To Do This Week:
