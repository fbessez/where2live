To Do:
	Form options:
		Create Options for cities
		Create Options for jobs --> the indeed ones...

	Maybe down the middle put a description of what the service does

	Handle when there are no results yet
	Handle when there is one results already
	Handle when there are two results already
		Need to check first if I am receiving two or one results...
		Then need to alter the right side if only one to say "Try Searching Again To Compare..."
		Then need to alter the submit button to submit to a different url if looking for second
		Then need to alter the bottom-comparison --> on the left if only one or in middle if both

		It really should be customizable to remove left or right.
		Need to be able to delete an entry.

		Maybe it's just easier to have two different html for these two cases.

		I'm sure Flask can handle this somehow!
